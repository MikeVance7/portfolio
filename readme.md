# Welcome!
My name is `Michael Vance`, and this is a portfolio of some of my code. Much of this I wrote for school projects, but all of it was written by me and is my work.  
  
If you have any questions you can reach me at van11025@byui.edu.
## Python 
 
Python is a very popular language, as it is fairly intuitive and simple to use. I have a few scripts here in it: one for a simple Fibonacci Sequence, one for searching a JSON file, and one for sorting a JSON file.
## PowerShell
PowerShell is fantastic. It comes standard with every version of windows, and PowerShell Core is available on linux as well (Although it is missing a few features). One of the things that makes it so wonderful is that it works in objects, not just text. It also has access to the .net libraries, which is a nice bonus.  
I have a simple guessing game, a few simple Network Utilities (Like testing connectivity, or verifying ip addresses), and a more complex script for reading in Active Directory Users and OUs from an XML file and creating the proper OUs and Users based on it.

## SQL
I have experience writing queries in several SQL languages, and I am capable of table creation and design to an acceptable level of normalization. Although not available here on GitHub I do have a simple LAMP stack website I built using a raspberry pi I can demo upon request.
